\section{Introduction}

Examples can be found in \texttt{InstallDirectory/examples}. Each example includes a \texttt{SystemFile} as well as chemical input file. To run a given example once the M3SYM executable is created, go to the \texttt{InstallDirectory} and run the following:\newline

\indent \texttt{> ./M3SYM -s ./examples/<ExampleFolder>/system.txt}\newline
\indent\indent \texttt{-i ./examples/<ExampleFolder>/  -o <OutputDirectory>}\newline

\noindent where \texttt{<ExampleFolder>} is the specific example folder desired, and \texttt{<OutputDirectory>} is the directory of the desired output. See the usage guide for more details on these files and directories.


\section{A basic cytoskeletal network}

This example, a basic cytoskeletal network with alpha-actinin cross-linkers and myosin IIA motors, can be found in
\texttt{InstallDirectory/examples/actinnetwork}. This is set up to be a 20s simulation.

\subsection{Initial system configuration}
 
 This example is set up with the following initial configuration:
 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Compartment size of 100nm, in a 10x10x10 grid 
 \item 0.5um diameter spherical boundary
 \item 50 randomly placed filaments, all initially 0.02um
 \end{itemize}

\subsection{Chemistry involved}

This example is set up with the following chemical configuration:

\begin{itemize}
\item Diffusing actin, Arp2/3, and alpha-actinin species
\item Initial concentrations of 10uM, 50nM, and 200nM respectively.
\item Actin polymerization and depolymerization
\item Alpha-actinin binding and unbinding
\item Arp2/3 branching and unbranching

\end{itemize}

\noindent For more information on the reaction constants and concentrations chosen, see (*paper*).

\subsection{Mechanics involved}

This example is set up with the following mechanical configuration:

\begin{itemize}
\item Harmonic actin filament stretching force field
\item Harmonic actin filament bending force field
\item Harmonic alpha actinin cross-linker stretching force field
\item Harmonic branch stretching and cosine angle force field
\item Exponential boundary force field
\item Repulsive excluded volume force field
\end{itemize}

\noindent Dynamic reaction rate changes involving these force fields, including alpha-actinin unbinding, were tuned to fit single molecule experiments.\newline\newline
\noindent For more information on the force field parameters chosen, please see (*paper*).
