Goals for June 2014
--------

Compartment:
1. Make a general nD compartment (DONE)
2. Make a general nD compartment grid (container) (DONE)
3. Tests for compartments


Filopodia:
Reactions needed: (seperate tests for each reaction!)
    -Polymerization/Depolymerization at barbed end
    -Depolymerization at pointed end
    -capping and anti-capping
    -Aging reactions
    -Walking motors


1. Implement a simple simulation of filopodial growth
2. Somehow implement retrograde flow
2. Write tests and documentation for filopodial simulations

Testing/Documentation:
x. Write tests for visitors (use example_composite)
x. Document compartment and related classes
x. Write tests for compartment and related classes
x. Document reactionContainer, tests
