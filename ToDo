1) Combining code
    -Compiling all of cytosim and cytomech together                             X
    -Organizing code into folders                                               X
2) Finishing touches
    -Combine common files                                                       X
    -Filament input file                                                        X
    -Out of bounds management                                                   X
    -Moving cylinders, placing new cylinders                                     X
    -Boundary hard wall potential
    -SpeciesBulk implementation                                                 X
    -Depolymerizing front / back?
3) TESTING!!!!
    -Boundaries
    -SpeciesBulk
    -Geometry
    -FilamentElement / Cylinders
    -Chem initializer
    -Filaments (polymerize, depolymerize, intialization)
4) Simple use cases
    -Polymer melt
    -Basic actin network?

Logistical things:
-Change name of code / project?

WISH LIST
-Preprocessor macros set at command line?
