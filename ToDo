Goals for December 2014
------

1) More features
    -Fix reaction initialization / management                                   X
    -New Neighbors list implementation                                          X
    -Get rid of chemIniitializer, change to manager                             X
    -Database access : keys??? REMOVE THEM                                      X
    -Move bead / boundary element neighbors list to global                      X
    -Cylindrical + half sphere boundary                                         X
    -Excluded volume working                                                    X
    -Debug linker and motors                                                    X
    -Add branching reaction
    -Add severing reaction
    -Add aging reactions                                                        X
    -Fix signal copying                                                         X
    -Add changing reaction rates (poly, linker & motor)
    -Motor step size, rethinking of stepping (numbindingsites)                  X
    -Filament creation and destruction
    -Optimizations (Data structures (especially reaction dependents, dbs),      
                    Virtuals, inlines, friends of db!)
    -Formatting (80C lines, cleaning up other things, usage, googlecode)
    -Timings for larger systems

2) Testing:
    -Cylinder reaction management                                               X
    -Geometry findCompartments                                                  X
    -Filament (initialization, poly, depoly) (general, chem, mech)
    -Linker/Motor (general, chem, mech)
    -Neighbors lists
    -All FF's
