Goals for June 2014
--------

Filopodia:
Reactions needed: (seperate tests for each reaction!)
    -Polymerization/Depolymerization at barbed end
    -Depolymerization at pointed end
    -capping and anti-capping
    -Aging reactions
    -Walking motors


1. Implement a simple simulation of filopodial growth
2. Somehow implement retrograde flow
2. Write tests and documentation for filopodial simulations

Testing/Documentation:
x. Write tests for compartment and compartment container
x. Write tests for visitors (use example_composite)
x. Document reactionContainer, tests
