#include <thread>

// The implementation for thread pooling in MEDYAN.
//
// Purpose: Increase performance by running computational-heavy work on
//   multiple threads (possibly multiple processor cores). Thread pooling helps
//   balance work loads according to the avaiable processors, and reduces
//   the overhead of creating/destroying threads.
//
// Interface:
//   - The thread pool should be globally accessible in MEDYAN, so all the
//     interface functions must be thread-safe.
//   - Can push tasks to the queue.
//   - Can obtain the return value via a future.
//   - Can explicitly wait for specific tasks to complete.
//   - Tasks waiting for other tasks can work on pending tasks.
//   - Can terminate running tasks (via setting and polling shared states).
//
// Possible Additional Features
//   [ ] priority queues
//   [ ] thread idle/contention stats and recommendations
//   [ ] automatic load balancing
