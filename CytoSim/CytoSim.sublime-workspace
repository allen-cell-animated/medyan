			"Away from the leading edge and behind the lamellipodium, there is the lamellum which is composed of \ncontractile bundles of actin filaments. Lamelliopodium and lamellum are weakly coupled and two distinct\nactin networks that overlap~\\cite{Ponti2004}. 2D computer simulation shows that self-organization of actin\nnetwork could form lamllipodium and lamellum~\\cite{Huber2008}.  By modeling lamellipodium and lamellum \nas elastic gels, Shemesh \\textit{et al.} suggested a mechanism of the lamellipodium-lamellum boundary formation, \nshape formation, and progression based on the elastic stresses generated in the lamellipodia actin gel by its \nfriction against the focal adhesion~\\cite{Shemesh2009}. A 1D mathematical model describing the reaction-diffusion\nof the actin network reproduces the essential characteristics of the lamellipodium-lamellum~\\cite{Stuhrmann2011}. Myosin-II condenses actin filaments in lamellipodium into actin arcs, which are suggested to serve as a structural \nelement underlying the spatio-temporal connection between the lamellipodium and the lamellum during cell migration~\\cite{Burnette2011}. Molecular components that controls properties of actin filaments such as the length \nalso play a role in regulating actin network transitions. For example, Arp2/3 and capping proteins are required for\nthe formation of lamellipodia, and decreased capping activity could lead to lamellipodium collapse and lamellum expansion~\\cite{Iwasa2007}.

			"The cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells is a remarkable system that provides structural support, determines\ncell shapes, and also allows cells to migrate through its dynamic remodeling. The core of the cytoskeleton\nis a network of filaments including actin filaments and microtubules as well as the intermediate filaments. \nActin filaments are dynamic and play important roles in many cellular processes such as motility --- the \npolymerization of actin filaments generates force to drive the crawling movement of cells. Cell migration \nis central to many biological  processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, and immune response.\n",
			"Actin-based cell motility is essential to eukaryotic cells. It is a highly coordinated process involving the \ninteractions of actin and many regulatory proteins. Mathematical modeling and computer simulations \nhave helped advance our understanding of actin dynamics in cell motility. \nIn this article, we review recent advances in computational modeling of actin-based motility. \nWe focus on a particular type of leading edge membrane protrusion structure, the lamellipodium in motile\ncells, and discuss physico-chemical regulation of its formation and force generation mechanism.\n"
