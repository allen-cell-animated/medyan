Cell motility plays a key role in human biology and disease, contributing ubiquitously to such important processes as embryonic development, wound repair and cancer metastasis. Papoian laboratory is interested in gaining deeper understanding of the physical chemistry behind these complex, far-\/from-\/equilibrium mechano-\/chemical processes. His approach and model, named Mechano-\/chemical Dynamics of Active Networks, 3rd Generation (M\+E\+D\+Y\+A\+N3), is based on combining stochastic reaction-\/diffusion treatment of cellular biochemical processes with polymer physics of cytoskeletal filament network growth, while explicitly coupling chemistry and mechanics.

Papoian laboratory has developed {\bfseries M3\+S\+Y\+M}, a software package based on the M\+E\+D\+Y\+A\+N3 model, to simulate growth dynamics of actin based filamentous networks {\itshape in vitro} and {\itshape in vivo}. Recent papers where {\bfseries M3\+S\+Y\+M} or its predecessor, {\bfseries Stoch\+Tools}, were used can be found on the publication section of \href{http://papoian.chem.umd.edu/}{\tt the Papoian group's main web page\+:}. The {\bfseries M3\+S\+Y\+M} package can also be extended to simulate the dynamics of any active matter network.\hypertarget{index_install_sec}{}\section{Installation}\label{index_install_sec}
\hypertarget{index_step1}{}\subsection{Step 1\+: Prerequisites}\label{index_step1}
The following software packages need to be installed first\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Boost 1.\+49
\item G\+S\+L ...
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_step2}{}\subsection{Step 2\+: Installation of M3\+S\+Y\+M itself}\label{index_step2}
Untar the {\bfseries M3\+S\+Y\+M} source code into some directory, enter into the \char`\"{}\+M3\+S\+Y\+M\char`\"{} and execute \char`\"{}make\char`\"{} from the command line.
